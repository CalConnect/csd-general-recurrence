== Introduction

The iCalendar standard (<<RFC5545>>) has defined the de-facto standard
for specifying recurring time intervals.

However, its syntax is tightly bound to the syntax and assumptions
of <<RFC5545>>, requiring a data model representation that assumes
a hierarchy of properties, parameters and data types that are not
necessarily provided in other date and time representations,
such as the International Standard for date and time representation,
<<ISO8601>>.

<<RFC5545>> also relies on a number of indirect data inheritance
rules that are not clearly specified and therefore not easily
reproduced in other representations outside of iCalendar.

This document describes a method to specify recurring time intervals
with repeat rules in representation in line with those of the time
scale components and date and time representations described in
<<ISO8601>>.
