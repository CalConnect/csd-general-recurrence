== Interactions between eligible time intervals with the selection part

=== General

The interaction between eligible time intervals and selection rules
specified within a repeating rule give rise to interesting properties
that users should be aware of.

[[annexa-example]]
=== Sample evaluation of a recurring time interval with repeat rules

`R/20150104T083000/PT15M00S/F2YL1M1KT{8,9}H30MN` expresses a recurring
interval (number of occurrences is unspecified) whose first occurrence
is January 4, 2015, 8:30-8:45 AM, and subsequent occurrences, all of
the same duration (15 minutes), are determined by the repeat cycle for
which the following evaluation sequence is provided.

* the character `F` indicates that the formula for determining eligible
time intervals follows;

* the expression `2Y` indicates that the eligible time intervals have a
repeating cycle of two years, and each eligible time interval is 1 year
in length, the second year within its repeating interval;

* From this information together with the specification of the first
occurrence, it is calculated that:

** the first eligible time interval is the calendar year 2015 (the year
during which the first occurrence takes place)

** the first repeating interval is the two-year period comprising
calendar years 2014 and 2015;

* the subsequent recurring intervals are then determined by the
selection part;

** the character `L` indicates that selection parts follow;

** the expression `1M` indicates that the matching occurrences are
limited to January only;

** the expression `1K` indicates that the matching occurrences are
limited to Sundays only;

** the expression `T` indicates that intraday time scale components
follow;

** the expression `{8,9}H` indicates that the matching occurrences have
clock hours 8 or 9;

** the expression `30M` indicates that the matching occurrences have a
clock minute value of 30, combined with specified clock hours, the
starting times are determined to be 8:30AM and 9:30 AM;

** since the selection rules lacks specified values for clock seconds,
in accordance with 9.3.3, they should be obtained from the clock
seconds value of the "`time interval start`" of `20150104T083000`, hence
the clock seconds selection rule is specified as value `00`;

** the recurrent occurrences therefore resolve to the rule "`in the second
year of every two year period beginning year 2014, for every Sunday in January at both 8:30:00 AM
and 9:30:00 AM, create a 15 minutes occurence.`"

<<figure-basic-recurrences>> demonstrates that the repeating cycle
denotes how often the eligible time intervals be evaluated. Within the
eligible time intervals, the selection rules are applied. It is the
overlap between the selection rules and eligible time intervals that
produce the resulting occurrences.

[[annexa-special-case]]
=== Special case when the repeating cycle uses value 1

When the repeating cycle is defined with a value 1 for any time unit
(e.g. calendar year, calendar month, calendar day, calendar hour,
etc.), the effect on the resulting occurrences are identical â€“ the
repeating cycle fully covers all instants of the time scale. Therefore,
the resulting occurrences are fully described by the selection rules
that apply.

=== Orders of the repeating cycle and selection rules

==== Repeating cycle of higher order than selection rules

It is common in natural expressions and in calendar implementations
that the repeating cycle uses a time scale unit of a higher order than
that of the selection rules. The resulting occurrences are generally as
expected by the creator of these rules.

[example]
<<figure-higher-order>> provides such a case; where the resulting
occurrences happen once every three years, matching a single date of
September 10th.

[[annexa-same-order]]
==== Repeating cycle of same order with selection rules

When a time scale unit of the same order is used for both the repeating
cycle and the selection rules, the following properties arise:

* The effect of <<annexa-special-case>> applies;

[example]
A repeating rule of 1 month repeating cycle, with selection rules that
are of the highest order of "`month`", has the same effect as the
repeating cycle of 1 calendar year because every calendar month in the
calendar year will be evaluated

* A repeating rule with an n time unit repeating cycle, matched with
selection rules of the same time unit, will provide occurrences that
depend on the start instant of the repeating cycle.

[example]
A repeating cycle starting in April every 6 months will only match a
monthly selection rule that contains April or October

[example]
<<figure-same-order>> demonstrates an instance of the second case where
the repeating cycle does not overlap with eligible time intervals,
resulting in no occurrences.

==== Repeating cycle of lower order than selection rules

When a time scale unit of a lower order is used for the repeating cycle
than that of the selection rules, the following should be of note:

* The effect of <<annexa-special-case>> applies;

* A repeating rule with an n time unit repeating cycle, matched with
selection rules of a lower order time unit, will provide occurrences
that depend on the start instant of the repeating cycle.

[example]
<<figure-lower-order>> demonstrates this interaction of the second
case, where the repeating cycle is of day order and a selection rule of
calendar month order. Notice that there are no matches outside calendar
month 3 due to the application of the selection rule.
